# System Check
# Make sure you have Ruby installed, can run code in irb, and can run Ruby scripts (files that end in ".rb"). Type ruby -v in your command line, and make sure you're using Ruby 2.x.

# If you are having trouble installing Ruby or running into other environment issues, we highly recommend using a cloud-based IDE, such as Cloud 9. That way, you can focus on learning programming, rather than getting stuck on environment or system issues.

# Being an online program, it's very hard for us to help you debug those types of problems, and it's probably not where you want to spend a lot of time right now.
