# Set up your profile image
# In our program, we'll be using your profile image throughout the site and especially in the forums. If you've linked your Github account, we'll be using the image from your Github.com profile.

# If you did not link your Github account, we'll try to pull it from Gravatar, a 3rd party profile image provider.

# We strongly recommend linking your Github account so we can easily access your code to help you, so make sure you have a valid Github.com profile image. After you have it set up, it should automatically pop up in the forums after some time -- usually, almost immediately.
