# Git and Github
# Throughout all our courses, you'll be committing all your work locally to a git repository. As you progress, you'll push those local commits to a remote git repository hosted on Github.com.

# Make sure the Github repositories are public, so we can see your code. We'll talk about code hygiene, working with teams, etc later in the program, but for now, you should follow these guidelines:

# commit liberally to your local repository.
# push liberally to your remote Github repository.
# make sure to push all your work-in-progress work to the Github repository when asking for help. This is the only way we can help you, since this is the only way we can see your progress.
# in this course, it's ok to use just one git repository. Make sure to create a new directory for each lesson, so it's easy for us to find your code. Do not create a nested git repository within a larger git repository.
# when we move on to web development projects, you will be forced to have a separate repository per project, but that is not a requirement for now.
# in later lessons, we may demonstrate places where you'd want to create a separate git repository to organize code. When you do that, make sure to not nest git repositories.
