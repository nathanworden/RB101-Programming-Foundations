# Welcome
# This is the first assignment of the first lesson of the first Ruby course, so the first thing we want to say is: Welcome!

# Discussions vs General Forums
# There will be a separate discussion forum for each lesson, so make sure to ask the question in the appropriate forum. All forums are staffed by TAs around the world, so feel free to post questions any time. If you haven't yet, stop now to take time to find them: there should be a link at the top of the lesson called "Discussions". This is where you should ask lesson-specific questions, and this is where our TAs will be monitoring.

# There are also "General Forums" that are not lesson specific and open to anyone. You can get to the "General Forums" from the side navigation bar (it's just called "Forum"). Those are different from the lesson-specific discussions. Be sure to also check out the General Forums periodically, as that's where you can collaborate with your fellow students who are not in your current lesson.

# How To Ask For Feedback
# The most efficient way to get good feedback or help is to treat questions to the forums as questions you'd ask a co-worker. Lead with the error message, or describe in detail how the error happens. Outline the steps you've taken so far to address the problem, and then make a guess as to where the problem lies. Paste a link to your code - this is probably your Github repository. Try to paste the exact file, so people don't have to dig up which file you're talking about.

# If the error output is very long, don't paste the entire thing into the forums. Use a Gist or Pastebin and include the link. Your question will be sent to all other students in the lesson, and many of them can help you, so the easier you make it for others, the more likely they will just hit "reply" and give an answer. There will be times where others will have to pull your code down, run it on their machines, debug it, then tell you the answer, so it's possible they'll spend some time on your problem. By describing what debugging steps you've already taken and where you think the problem is, you'll direct their efforts in the right path.

# The more vague the question, the longer it will take to resolve, as everyone tries to eliminate the low hanging fruit and try to gain a deeper understanding of the problem. Sometimes, you will find that you figure out the problem just by taking the time to outline the problem step-by-step to others. This is such a common phenomenon that there's a phrase for it: rubber duck debugging. Therefore, take the time to outline your problem when asking for help. This will help clarify the problem for others, allow you to receive help much faster, and it may also help you solve on your own issue.

# Github Repository
# All your code in our courses should be pushed to Github repositories. For this course, you can use 1 repository, but create a separate folder for each lesson. When asking for help, make sure your code from your local machine is pushed to your Github repository. This is really important, as it's the only way we can help you.

# Helping Each Other
# One of the benefits of going through a program like this is the other motivated students who are taking the course with you. We encourage you to get to know each other, by way of helping and pushing each other. We've seen graduates pair off after the program and start their own projects, and refer each other for jobs. After you take this program, you'll have spent a significant amount of time learning with each other, so take time to encourage, motivate, help and learn from each other.

# Feel free to ask questions, but go beyond "it doesn't work" or "I'm having issues". Take time to describe what exactly is not working, what the steps are to reproduce it, and any debugging steps you've already taken, and include a link to the code. Doing this will lead to much faster and more helpful responses.
