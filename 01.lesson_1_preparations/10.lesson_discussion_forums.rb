# Lesson Discussion Forums
# Each lesson has its own discussion forum, accessible via the 'discussion' tab on the lesson's home page. These forums contain discussion threads initiated by other students to ask questions about course concepts, request code reviews, and get help debugging common errors. You are encouraged to use the existing threads as a learning tool. Feel free to read through them and use the search function at the top of the page.

# You may also see threads pinned at the top of the lesson forums. Pinned threads are important or helpful discussions. They often answer frequently asked questions and may help you avoid common pitfalls. We ask that you take the time to read all of the pinned threads in the discussion forum for each lesson.

# After completing a course assignment, you may request a code review in the lesson discussion forum. Please read through our Code Review Guidelines.
