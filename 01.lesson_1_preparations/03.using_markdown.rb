# Using Markdown
# Our forums use Markdown, which is a special syntax for formatting text. Specifically, it takes a special flavor of markdown called Github flavored markdown, which as you can guess, is used by Github.

# Using markdown allows everyone to format code as well as text when posting messages in the forums. If you’ve never used markdown before, it’s really easy if you take time to look over the syntax.

# Make sure to click on the “Formatting Help” link when making a post for some quick hints. One thing to pay special attention to is to not just copy/paste code into the discussion forum. It’s likely going to be very ugly.

# Make sure to surround code with back ticks and not apostrophes. The backtick character is usually in the top left of your keyboard. And, of course, use the Preview functionality to double check that the output looks what you expect, especially if you copy/paste code or console output.
