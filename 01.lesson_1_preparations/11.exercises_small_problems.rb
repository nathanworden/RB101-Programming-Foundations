# Exercises: Small Problems
# While you're working through this course, you should concurrently work through the "Small Problems" exercises from the Exercises tab. We recommend that you do 10 exercises (or 1 set) per week. At the assessment, you'll see instructions for completing all of the Small Problems exercises, so doing 10 per week will help spread that work out a little bit.

# The Small Problems should take around 10-30 minutes to complete, and some of them may even take significantly longer period of time. You may want to even space out the 10 exercises over the week evenly, tackling a couple per day.

# Before working on the Small Problems, take the time to read through our blog article about The Two-Layer Problem. This article addresses the challenge of solving a problem while simultaneously learning a new programming language.

# You'll also find that you may want to do these exercises multiple times to explore their depth and to truly allow the exercise to sink in.
