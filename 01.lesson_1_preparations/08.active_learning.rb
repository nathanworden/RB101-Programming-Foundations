# Active Learning
# There are a lot of videos in our program. Some are long while others are short. When you watch the videos, especially the long ones, it's important that you not just sit back and relax. Approach the videos like you would a lecture in school:

# make sure there are no external distractions (turn off tv, cell phone)
# take notes
# look up concepts you don't understand
# afterwards, try to articulate the concepts in your own words (this is one reason later in the course we ask you to blog about what you learned)
# don't browse Facebook, Twitter, etc while video is running
# visualize yourself in a classroom, and even fabricate some competition with fellow students, if that helps you stay motivated
# the videos are usually capped at 1 hour, so try to maintain active listening for that duration
# review your notes after the video to make sure you have captured the key concepts
# This course teaches you programming, but it's also important to learn how to learn, especially if it's been a while since you've been in school.
