# Welcome!

# Goal of Ruby lessons:
#  - build fluency in language syntax
#  - learn to think like a programmer
#  - learn to build applications
#  - debugging mindset

#  We'll cover a lot of topics, but you can categorize it into 3 main buckets:
#  - Learning to program procedurally
#  - OOP
#  - other stuff
#     - testing
#     - blocks
#     - tools
#     - problem solving
#     - developing familiarity with the language


# Learning to Code vs Learning to program
# - first, Ruby grammar & syntax (English grammar/vocabulary)
# - second, building applications (writing essays/novels)
# - very frusterating to jump between the two
# - psudo Code
