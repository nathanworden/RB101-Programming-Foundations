# Even Numbers
# Print the even numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive. All numbers should be printed on separate lines.

# Solution
# value = 1
# while value <= 99
#   puts value if value.even?
#   value += 1
# end
# Discussion
# Our solution is just a minor variation on the solution to print odd numbers. This time, though, we increment the value by 1 with every iteration, and only print it if it is even.
