# The General Approach for Problem Solving

# Small Code Challenge Problems
# - 20 - 45 minutes
# - typical solutions 10-40 Lines of Code
# - used extensively in interviews for a reason
#    - master of a language
#    - logic / reasoning
#    - communication
# - not a skill that you "acquire and file away", but need a lot of practice

# Understand the Problem
# - requirements are explicit
#   - take notes
#   - the odd words problem
# - requirements are not so explicit and need to be modeled
#   - requirements are showed with examples
#      - examples need to be described in computational words
#      - diamond of stars
#   - implicit knowledge needs to be captured
#      - convert to explict rules, incomputational language
#      - what centry is that
#   - identifying and defining imporant terms and concepts
#      - [queen attack (maybe an easy version?)](https://launchschoo.com/exercises/81d3afa6)
#      - same row; same colum; especially same diagnal
#   - ask questions to verify your understanding!

# Practice Problem
# Consider a character set consisting of letters, a space, and a point. Words consist
# of one or more, but at most 20 letters. An input text consists of one or more words
# separated from each other by one or more spaces and terminated by 0 or more spaces
# followed by a point. Input should be read from, and including, the first letter of
# the first word, up to and incluing the terminating point. The output text is to be
# produced such that successive words are separated by a single space with the last 
# word being termindated by a single point. Odd words are copied in reverse order
# while even words are merely echoed.

# For example, the input string
# "whats the matter with kansas."

# becomes
# "whats eht matter htiw kansas."

# Understanding the Problem:

#  - input:
#    - 1 - many words
#    - separated by: 1 - many spaces
#    - terminated by:
#        - 0-many spaces
#        - followed by a point
#    - characters: letter, space, point, up to 20 letters
#    - need to handle failure?
# - output
#    - words: have the odd words reversed
#    - separated by one space between words
#    - terminated: 0 space, followed by a dot
