# Palindromic Numbers
# Write a method that returns true if its integer argument is palindromic, false otherwise. A palindromic number reads the same forwards and backwards.

# Examples:

# palindromic_number?(34543) == true
# palindromic_number?(123210) == false
# palindromic_number?(22) == true
# palindromic_number?(5) == true
# Hide Solution & Discussion
# Solution
# def palindromic_number?(number)
#   palindrome?(number.to_s)
# end
# Discussion
# The hardest part of this program is recognizing that the easiest way to tell if a number is palindromic is to convert it to a string first, then check whether that string is palindromic. To determine if the string is palindromic, we use the palindrome? method we wrote earlier.

# Further Exploration
# Suppose your number begins with one or more 0s. Will your method still work? Why or why not? Is there any way to address this?
