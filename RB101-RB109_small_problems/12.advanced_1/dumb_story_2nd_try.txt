Once upon a time near the hills of Levendale, a young %{noun1} met his %{noun2} for the %{number1}th time.

“Me llamo %{name1}” the young %{noun1} told his %{noun2}.

“Me llamo %{name2}” said the %{noun2}.

“NOW WE %{verb1} TO THE DEATH” said a frog %{gerund} nearby.

“I don’t want to %{verb1} my %{noun2}!” said %{name1}.

“I don’t want to speak Spanish!” said %{name2}.

This is the part of the story where we put all your %{adjective1}, %{adjective2}, %{adjective3}, adjectives.

I mean, really, %{your_name}, your adjectives are literally so %{adjective4}, that you decided to put 
“%{adjective5}” as an adjective. Great work. I hope you are happy.

The end.
