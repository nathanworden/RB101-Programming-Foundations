Once upon a time near the hills of Levendale, a young Llama met his father for the first time.

“Me llamo es Yano” the young llama told his father.

“Me llamo es Lloyd” said the father.

“NOW WE FIGHT TO THE DEATH” said a frog sitting nearby.

“I don’t want to fight my father” said Yano.

“I don’ want to speak Spanish” said Lloyd.

The end.
