Once upon a time near the hills of Levendale, a young NOUN_1 met his NOUN_2 for the NUMBER time.

“Me llamo es NAME_1” the young NOUN_1 told his NOUN_2. 

“Me llamo es NAME_2” said the NOUN_2.

“NOW WE VERB_1 TO THE DEATH” said a frog, GERUND nearby.

“I don’t want to VERB_1 my NOUN_2!” said NAME_1.

“I don’ want to speak Spanish!” said NAME_2.

This is the part of the story where we put all your ADJECTIVE_1, ADJECTIVE_2, ADJECTIVE_3, adjectives.

I mean, really, YOUR_NAME, your adjectives are literally so ADJECTIVE_4, that you decided to put 
“ADJECTIVE_5” as an adjective. Great work. I hope you are happy.

The end.
