# Introduction
# Programming involves working with data. It's common for programmers to store, search and manipulate data as part of their day-to-day work. Think about that first action for a moment: storing. How do we store data? The answer for most programming languages is to put them into structured containers, or collections. Collections come in many different forms and it's useful to think of them as lists of data.

# In this lesson, we'll work with three of the most commonly used collection types in Ruby: String, Array, and Hash. You have already encountered these collection types in previous lessons and assignments; in this lesson we will explore them in greater depth.

# Before you start, make sure to create a peer directory to your lesson 3 code. Call it perhaps lesson_4, and do all your work in this lesson in that directory.

# work           <-- this is your course 1 git repo
# |
# +--lesson_2     <-- all lesson 2 code goes here
# |
# +--lesson_3     <-- all lesson 3 code goes here
# |
# +--lesson_4     <-- all lesson 4 code goes here

# As with the previous lesson, you don't need to run Rubocop on code in this lesson.
