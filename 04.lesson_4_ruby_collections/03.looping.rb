# Looping
# When working with collections, it's common to perform a single action on each element in a collection. Instead of writing the action over and over again, loops can be used to perform an action on many, if not all, of the elements in a collection.

# In the previous assignment we looked at manually incrementing all the integers in an array by 1. Here's a reminder of what that looked like.

# arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# arr[0] += 1
# arr[1] += 1
# arr[2] += 1
# arr[3] += 1
# arr[4] += 1
# arr # => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# You probably noticed that lines 2 - 6 of the above code are almost identical other than the index of the array that is being referenced. This is a relatively small array, but imagine if we needed to increment each value in a much larger array - say, one containing 20 or 30 integers or maybe even more. That would require the writing of a lot of repetitive code. Situations like this are where we can use a loop to do the hard work for us.

# arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# counter = 0

# loop do
#   arr[counter] += 1
#   counter += 1
#   break if counter == arr.size
# end

# arr # => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# If you understand this code immediately, you can skim the rest of this assignment. If you have a little bit of trouble with it, make sure to take notes and pay attention -- it's extremely critical.

# Controlling a Loop
# In Ruby, a simple loop is created by calling the Kernel#loop method and passing a block to it. Any code within the block will be executed each time the loop performs an iteration. Because the loop method is in the Kernel module, it's available everywhere, just like puts and gets.

# In the following loop, 'Hello!' will be printed an infinite number of times.

# loop do
#   puts 'Hello!'
# end
# If we add the reserved word break after puts 'Hello!' then the loop will only iterate once. This is because when break is executed, it exits the nearest loop.

# loop do
#   puts 'Hello!'
#   break
# end
# If we want loop to iterate more than once, we can use a conditional statement so that break is only called when a specific condition occurs. For example, let's say we have a variable named number that represents a random number. We can choose to exit the loop when number equals 5 by writing the if condition as number == 5.

# loop do
#   number = rand(1..10)   # a random number between 1 and 10
#   puts 'Hello!'
#   if number == 5
#     puts 'Exiting...'
#     break
#   end
# end
# Try running this code a few times (either from a code file or in irb) and make a note of what you notice.

# Once you've done this compare your notes against those below:Hide Notes
# 'Hello!' is output one or more times
# 'Exiting...' is output once
# On each iteration:

# number is assigned to a random number between 1 and 10
# 'Hello!' is output
# The if statement checks if number is equal to 5
# If so 'Exiting...' is output and break is called (which ends the loop)
# If not then the loop repeats
# Iteration
# Although we have an if condition for break, we still don't know how many times the loop will iterate because number represents a random number. We can tell loop to iterate a specific number of times by using a variable that tracks the number of iterations performed. Before loop is implemented, let's assign a variable counter that represents the current iteration number.

# In order to align the value of counter and the number of iterations, we need to increment counter by 1 during each iteration. This will ensure that loop only iterates five times.

# counter = 0

# loop do
#   puts 'Hello!'
#   counter += 1
#   break if counter == 5
# end
# Notice that counter is initialized outside of the loop. If we had initialized it inside of the loop it would be reassigned to 0 on each iteration and the break condition would never be met.

# if modifier

# Here we shortened the if statement by changing it to an if modifier. An if modifier is implemented by appending the keyword if and the condition to a statement. In this case, the statement is break.

# break if number == 5
# This generally makes the code more readable but should only be used when applicable. If there are multiple lines of code within the if statement then a modifier can't be used (notice we removed the puts ' Exiting...' line).

# Break Placement
# This example of loop - where break is placed on the last line within the loop - mimics the behavior of a "do/while" loop. With a "do/while" loop, the code within the block is guaranteed to execute at least once.

# If we move break to the first line within the loop, this will then mimic the behavior of a while loop. The while keyword always precedes a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the loop will execute the code within the block. If the condition evaluates to false, the loop will stop. This means the code below break may or may not execute at all, depending on the condition.

# In our example, if we move break to the first line within the loop and change the condition to counter == 0, then the loop will stop immediately and not execute any code after break.

# counter = 0

# loop do
#   break if counter == 0
#   puts 'Hello!'
#   counter += 1
# end
# Next
# Besides break, Ruby also provides the next keyword to help us control loops. When next is executed, it tells the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and begin the next one. We can choose to skip the current iteration when counter represents an odd number by adding an if modifier to next with the condition counter.odd?.

# Note: #odd? is a method of Integer which returns true if an integer is odd and false if it isn't. (You can check the Ruby documentation for more information on this and other methods).

# counter = 0

# loop do
#   counter += 1
#   next if counter.odd?
#   puts counter
#   break if counter > 5
# end
# Notice that when we added next, we also had to move counter += 1 so that it's executed first. Similar to break, when next is executed, any code after it will be ignored. If the counter incrementation code was placed after next, then it wouldn't be incremented if next is executed, which will result in an infinite loop.

# The if condition also had to be changed from counter == 5 to counter > 5 since 5 is an odd number.

# Iterating Over Collections
# Now that we understand the basics of looping, we'll look at how we can use loops to iterate over collections.

# String
# Let's implement a loop that iterates over a given string and prints each character.

# alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
# counter = 0

# loop do
#   break if counter == alphabet.size
#   puts alphabet[counter]
#   counter += 1
# end
# In order to print each character in the string, we need to iterate over the entire string, and use string reference to retrieve each letter based on its index. Since our counter starts at 0, we can just use that. We'll break out of the loop when the counter equals the length of the alphabet string.

# Note: String#size returns the number of characters in the given string. You could also use String#length which does the same thing.

# To print a specific character in a string, we use the index value associated with the specific character. Since counter represents the current iteration number, we can use its value as the index value for each character. This results in every character being printed one at a time.

# In the above example, the ordering of counter += 1 and our break modifier doesn't matter too much. If we move things around, the worst that can happen is we get one extra piece of unneeded output, a blank line. Regardless, all letters of the alphabet will be output. But, the ordering could matter, depending on various starting conditions. There are some edge cases to take into account when looping through strings in general.

# If our counter somehow surpassed the alphabet.size modifier, then we could end up with an infinite loop. For instance, if we started with an empty string, and then incremented counter, and then checked a condition with the above if modifier, that would cause an infinite loop. Or if counter started at the size of alphabet. Then, we would once again get an infinite loop.

# Using a more general condition in our if modifier may be in order. Using something like, break if counter >= alphabet.size, should do the trick. This would always guarantee that we break out of the loop regardless of whether counter is exactly equal to alphabet.size or not.

# What if the string includes spaces? Since strings can only contain characters, we know that a space is also a character. If the string was 'a b c' for example, each character would be printed, including the spaces.

# a

# b

# c
# Array
# To iterate over an array, we can use loop in the same way we did with a string.

# colors = ['green', 'blue', 'purple', 'orange']
# counter = 0

# loop do
#   break if counter == colors.size
#   puts "I'm the color #{colors[counter]}!"
#   counter += 1
# end
# What do you think will be output by the loop?Hide
# The result is the string "I'm the color ... !" being printed four times with the values of each element interpolated into it each time in order.

# I'm the color green!
# I'm the color blue!
# I'm the color purple!
# I'm the color orange!
# In the above example the array only contains string objects, however, arrays can contain any type of Ruby object and can contain different types of objects at the same time.

# Let's modify the array so it contains various types of objects. Let's also modify puts so that it prints the name of the class of each object. To do this, we can use the class method which returns the name of the calling object's class.

# objects = ['hello', :key, 10, []]
# counter = 0

# loop do
#   break if counter == objects.size
#   puts objects[counter].class
#   counter += 1
# end
# Now our output looks a bit different.

# String
# Symbol
# Fixnum
# Array
# Hash
# Using loop to iterate over a hash is a bit more difficult -- it requires a couple more steps. This is because hashes use key-value pairs instead of a zero-based index. This means that each value in a hash is associated with a specific key. Since hash keys can be any type of object, a simple counter variable won't allow us to fetch the values we want.

# number_of_pets = {
#   'dogs' => 2,
#   'cats' => 4,
#   'fish' => 1
# }
# pets = number_of_pets.keys # => ['dogs', 'cats', 'fish']
# counter = 0

# loop do
#   break if counter == number_of_pets.size
#   current_pet = pets[counter]
#   current_pet_number = number_of_pets[current_pet]
#   puts "I have #{current_pet_number} #{current_pet}!"
#   counter += 1
# end
# To remedy this, we have to create an array containing all of the keys in the hash. We can do this by using Hash#keys, which returns an array containing all of the keys in the hash. We can then use the new array of keys, pets, to iterate over the hash.

# The important thing to realize here is that this is a two step process. First, we're iterating over the array of keys, pets, and saving each key into the current_pet variable. We then use the current_pet key to retrieve the appropriate value out of the number_of_pets hash.

# The puts statement interpolates both the current hash value, current_pet_number, and the current hash key, current_pet, into the "I have ... !" string.

# I have 2 dogs!
# I have 4 cats!
# I have 1 fish!
# Summary
# Looping comprises four basic elements: a loop, a counter, a way to retrieve the current value, and a way to exit the loop. It's important to understand how to manually loop over collections with nothing more than these 4 tools. It's often tempting to go "method hunting" to search for a method to iterate over a collection, but if you master the basics of looping, you'll find that you can perform nearly any operation you need with the simple techniques in this assignment. Methods can be useful, but they shouldn't be used as a crutch.

# In the following assignments, you'll see how to combine looping with a few other tools to manipulate collections according to your will.





number_of_pets = {
  'dogs' => 2,
  'cats' => 4,
  'fish' => 1
}


pets = number_of_pets.keys
counter = 0

loop do
  break if counter == number_of_pets.size
  current_pet = pets[counter]
  current_pet_number = number_of_pets[current_pet]
  puts "I have #{current_pet_number} #{current_pet}!"
  counter += 1
end
