# Methods
# Using loops, such as loop or for, to iterate over a collection can become very repetitive. Ruby provides an easier way to work with collections through the use of built-in methods. In this assignment we'll specifically look at the methods each, select, and map.

# each
# So far, we've learned that the most effective option for iterating over a collection is to use a loop, like this:

# numbers = [1, 2, 3]
# counter = 0

# loop do
#   break if counter == numbers.size
#   puts numbers[counter]
#   counter += 1
# end
# Iterating over a collection is such a common task that Ruby provides a method to do just that. The each method is functionally equivalent to using loop and represents a simpler way of accomplishing the same task. Here's an example that produces the same result as the implementation above:

# [1, 2, 3].each do |num|
#   puts num
# end
# In this example, we're working with an array.

# [1, 2, 3]
# each is a method that's being called on the array.

# .each
# The method takes a block, which is the do â€¦ end part.

#                do |num|
#   puts num
# end
# The code within the block is executed for each iteration. In this case the code within the block is puts num which means each element in the array will be output by the puts method.

# How does the block know what num is? For each iteration, each sends the value of the current element to the block in the form of an argument. In this block, the argument to the block is num and it represents the value of the current element in the array.

# Since we're working with an array here, each knows that there's only one element per iteration, so each sends the block only one argument, num. Hashes, however, need two arguments in order to represent both the key and the value per iteration. Calling each on a hash looks a little different, since the block has two arguments:

# hash = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

# hash.each do |key, value|
#   puts "The key is #{key} and the value is #{value}"
# end
# We can iterate over an array or hash in a manual way by using loop, or we can iterate more idiomatically using each -- they're equivalent, for the most part. One of the main differences between them, however, is the return value. Once each is done iterating, it returns the original collection. We can verify this by testing it in irb.

# irb :001 > [1, 2, 3].each do |num|
# irb :002 >   puts num
# irb :003 > end
# 1
# 2
# 3
# => [1, 2, 3]    
# Note that [1, 2, 3].each is the last expression in the example above, despite there being some code in the block. Therefore, the return value of the entire expression is the return value of the each invocation, which is the original collection ([1, 2, 3]).

# We can see another example of this by placing each within a method. The return value of a_method is the return value of the last expression within the method. In this example we've slightly changed what happens in the block; now puts is outputting the number for each iteration multiplied by 2.

# def a_method
#   [1, 2, 3].each do |num|
#     puts num * 2
#   end
# end
# When calling the method we can clearly see that the return value is [1, 2, 3]. This is because the last expression in the method is [1, 2, 3].each, which has a return value of [1, 2, 3].

# a_method # => [1, 2, 3]
# What if we added a statement after #each? What will the return value of a_method be?

# def a_method
#   [1, 2, 3].each do |num|
#     puts num * 2
#   end

#   puts 'hi'
# end
# The return value of a_method has changed to nil. Why? The last expression within the method has changed from each to puts 'hi'. Since puts always returns nil, the return value of a_method is nil.

# a_method # => nil
# select
# We've explored a basic approach to performing selection with loop, but arrays and hashes also have a built-in way to iterate over a collection and perform selection: through a select method that makes doing this significantly easier. For example, instead of managing a loop manually with a counter and break condition, we can just do this:

# [1, 2, 3].select do |num|
#   num.odd?
# end
# To perform selection, select evaluates the return value of the block. The block returns a value on each iteration, which then gets evaluated by select. Similar to a real method, the return value of the block is the return value of the last expression within the block.

# When evaluating the block's return value, select only cares about its truthiness. Everything in Ruby is considered "truthy" except for nil and false. That's not exactly the same thing as saying everything except nil and false has a value of true in Ruby, but only that it is "truthy". It's a small, but important, distinction.

# If the return value of the block is "truthy", then the element during that iteration will be selected. If the return value of the block is "falsey" then the element will not be selected.

# [1, 2, 3].select do |num|
#   num + 1
# end
# For instance, the return value of the block in the above example will always be a "truthy" value. How do we know that? If the value is anything other than false or nil, it's a "truthy" value. In this case, the return value will always be an integer because num + 1 is the last expression within the block, so the block implicitly returns an integer, a truthy value.

# The next follow up question is, what will the return value of select be? select performs selection based on the truthiness of the block's return value. If the block's return value is always "truthy", then all of the elements will be selected. When an element is selected, it's placed in a new collection. In the above example, once select is done iterating, it returns a new collection containing all of the selected elements, because the selection criteria -- the block's return value -- is truthy for every element in the array.

# irb :001 > [1, 2, 3].select do |num|
# irb :002 >   num + 1
# irb :003 > end
# => [1, 2, 3]
# When working with select, it's important to always be aware of the return value of the block. For example, if we place the statement puts num on the last line within the block, how will that affect the return value of select?

# [1, 2, 3].select do |num|
#   num + 1
#   puts num
# end
# select will now return an empty array. Why is that? Since puts num is now the last evaluated expression in the block, it is the return value of this expression which determines the return value of the block. We know that puts always returns nil, therefore the return value of the block will now be nil, which is considered a "falsey" value. In other words, select won't select any elements because the return value will always be falsey.

# irb :001 > [1, 2, 3].select do |num|
# irb :002 >   num + 1
# irb :003 >   puts num
# irb :004 > end
# 1
# 2
# 3
# => []
# The above code can sometimes happen if you're debugging and inadvertently leave a trailing puts as the last expression of a block or method. A seemingly harmless puts can dramatically affect your program.

# map
# Similar to select, map also considers the return value of the block. The main difference between these two methods is that map uses the return value of the block to perform transformation instead of selection.

# [1, 2, 3].map do |num|
#   num * 2
# end
# In this example, the return value of the block is the product of num and 2. map then takes this value and places it in a new collection. This process is repeated for each element in the original collection. We can see what the return value of map looks like in irb.

# irb :001 > [1, 2, 3].map do |num|
# irb :002 >   num * 2
# irb :003 > end
# => [2, 4, 6]
# What happens if we write some code in the block that's not a transformation instruction?

# [1, 2, 3].map do |num|
#   num.odd?
# end
# The key to remember here is that map always performs transformation based on the return value of the block. In this case, the return value of the block will be a boolean. This means that the collection returned by map will be an array of booleans.

# irb :001 > [1, 2, 3].map do |num|
# irb :002 >   num.odd?
# irb :003 > end
# => [true, false, true]
# What will the return value of map be in the following example?

# [1, 2, 3].map do |num|
#   num.odd?
#   puts num
# end
# It's a little tricky, but you should now have all the necessary information to evaluate this code properly. Take a few minutes to deconstruct the above example and try to determine the return value of the code above.

# By looking at the last expression within the block, we know that the return value of the block will always be nil. map doesn't care about truthiness, and takes this return value as the transformation criteria. Therefore, the collection returned by map is a new array of nils.

# irb :001 > [1, 2, 3].map do |num|
# irb :002 >   num.odd?
# irb :003 >   puts num
# irb :004 > end
# 1
# 2
# 3
# => [nil, nil, nil]
# What if the only statement within the block is a string? What will the return value of map be?

# [1, 2, 3].map do |num|
#   'hi'
# end
# Since 'hi' is the only statement within the block, the return value of the block is 'hi', which map will use as the transformation criteria. Therefore, the above code will return an array where each element is 'hi'.

# irb :001 > [1, 2, 3].map do |num|
# irb :002 >   'hi'
# irb :003 > end
# => ["hi", "hi", "hi"]
# Enumerable
# At the start of this assignment it was stated that Ruby provides methods like each, select and map. While this is true in a general sense it is important to be aware that the picture is a little more complex in that not all methods are available to all different types of objects.

# Array and Hash both have an each method which is specific to them and defines how the items in those collections are iterated over.

# The select and map (and other) methods are actually defined in a module called Enumerable and are made available to the Array and Hash classes.

# Don't worry at this stage if some or all of this seems confusing; these Object Oriented Programming concepts will be covered in much more depth in later courses. The important thing to understand at this stage is that certain collection types have access to specific methods for a reason.

# For example String doesn't use the Enumerable module and so you cannot call select or map on a string (as we have already seen however we can easily convert a string to an array by calling String#split if we want access to the Enumerable methods of Array).

# Summary
# Methods like each, select and map are provided by Ruby to allow for simpler implementations of common collection manipulation tasks. Using these methods to iterate, select, and transform a collection is preferred over manually looping.

# To further clarify your understanding of these methods and how they work, use the following table as a reference:

# Method  Action  Considers the return value of the block?  Returns a new collection from the method? Length of the returned collection
# each  Iteration No  No, it returns the original Length of original
# select  Selection Yes, its truthiness Yes Length of original or less
# map Transformation  Yes Yes Length of original
# These methods each utilize the block's return value in their own way. In the case of each, the return value of the block is simply ignored. Before moving forward, it is crucial to understand how exactly these methods use the block's return value to perform their intended task.


# numbers = [1, 2, 3]
# counter = 0


# loop do 
#   break if counter == numbers.size
#   puts numbers[counter]
#   counter += 1
# end


[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end
