# Practice Problems: Methods and More Methods
# Now that we've explored a handful of methods and looked at how they work, let's do a few practice problems to help drive home the concepts we learned about in the last two assignments.

# The goal for these practice problems is to gain a deep understanding of specific concepts, not to rush through them. Do your best to answer the questions without running the example code. You should be able to determine the answers just by looking at the code or by referring to the Ruby docs.

# Practice Problem 1
# What is the return value of the select method below? Why?

# [1, 2, 3].select do |num|
#   num > 5
#   'hi'
# end
# Hide Solution
# # => [1, 2, 3]
# select performs selection based on the truthiness of the block's return value. In this case the return value will always be 'hi', which is a "truthy" value. Therefore select will return a new array containing all of the elements in the original array.

# Practice Problem 2
# How does count treat the block's return value? How can we find out?

# ['ant', 'bat', 'caterpillar'].count do |str|
#   str.length < 4
# end
# Hide Solution
# If we don't know how count treats the block's return value, then we should consult the docs for Array#count. Our answer is in the description:

# If a block is given, counts the number of elements for which the block returns a true value.

# Based on this information, we can conclude that count only counts an element if the block's return value evaluates to true. This means that count considers the truthiness of the block's return value.

# Practice Problem 3
# What is the return value of reject in the following code? Why?

# [1, 2, 3].reject do |num|
#   puts num
# end
# Hide Solution
# # => [1, 2, 3]
# Since puts always returns nil, you might think that no values would be selected and an empty array would be returned. The important thing to be aware of here is how reject treats the return value of the block. reject returns a new array containing items where the block's return value is "falsey". In other words, if the return value was false or nil the element would be selected.

# Practice Problem 4
# What is the return value of each_with_object in the following code? Why?

# ['ant', 'bear', 'cat'].each_with_object({}) do |value, hash|
#   hash[value[0]] = value
# end
# Hide Solution
# # => { "a" => "ant", "b" => "bear", "c" => "cat" }
# Based on our knowledge of each, it might be reasonable to think that each_with_object returns the original collection. That isn't the case, though. When we invoke each_with_object, we pass in an object ({} here) as an argument. That object is then passed into the block and it's updated value is returned at the end of each iteration. Once each_with_object has iterated over the calling collection, it returns the initially given object, which now contains all of the updates.

# In this code, we start with the hash object, {}. On the first iteration, we add "a" => "ant" to the hash. On the second, we add "b" => "bear", and on the last iteration, we add "c" => "cat". Thus, #each_with_object in this example returns a hash with those 3 elements.

# Practice Problem 5
# What does shift do in the following code? How can we find out?

# hash = { a: 'ant', b: 'bear' }
# hash.shift
# Hide Solution
# shift destructively removes the first key-value pair in hash and returns it as a two-item array. If we didn't already know how shift worked, we could easily learn by checking the docs for Hash#shift. The description for this method confirms our understanding:

# Removes a key-value pair from hsh and returns it as the two-item array [ *key, value* ], or the hashâ€™s default value if the hash is empty.

# There are quite a few Ruby methods, and you're not expected to know them all. That's why knowing how to read the Ruby documentation is so important. If you don't know how a method works you can always check the docs.

# Practice Problem 6
# What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

# ['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size
# Hide Solution
# # => 11
# There are a couple things going on here. First, pop is being called on the array. pop destructively removes the last element from the calling array and returns it. Second, size is being called on the return value by pop. Once we realize that size is evaluating the return value of pop (which is "caterpillar") then the final return value of 11 should make sense.

# Practice Problem 7
# What is the block's return value in the following code? How is it determined? Also, what is the return value of any? in this code and what does it output?

# [1, 2, 3].any? do |num|
#   puts num
#   num.odd?
# end
# Hide Solution
# The return value of the block is determined by the return value of the last expression within the block. In this case the last statement evaluated is num.odd?, which returns a boolean. Therefore the block's return value will be a boolean, since Fixnum#odd? can only return true or false.

# Since the Array#any? method returns true if the block ever returns a value other than false or nil, and the block returns true on the first iteration, we know that any? will return true. What is also interesting here is any? stops iterating after this point since there is no need to evaluate the remaining items in the array; therefore, puts num is only ever invoked for the first item in the array: 1.

# Practice Problem 8
# How does take work? Is it destructive? How can we find out?

# arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# arr.take(2)
# Hide Solution
# If you're unsure of how a method works the best thing to do is to read its documentation. Along with that, testing the method in irb can be very helpful. In this case we can quickly check if take is destructive or not by running the code in irb.

# irb :001 > arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# irb :002 > arr.take(2)
# => [1, 2]
# irb :003 > arr
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# By reading the docs and testing the method in irb, we're able to determine that Array#take selects a specified number of elements from an array. We're also able to verify that it isn't a destructive method.

# Practice Problem 9
# What is the return value of map in the following code? Why?

# { a: 'ant', b: 'bear' }.map do |key, value|
#   if value.size > 3
#     value
#   end
# end
# Hide Solution
# # => [nil, "bear"]
# There are some interesting things to point out here. First, the return value of map is an array, which is the collection type that map always returns. Second, where did that nil come from? If we look at the if condition (value.size > 3), we'll notice that it evaluates to true when the length of value is greater than 3. In this case, the only value with a length greater than 3 is 'bear'. This means that for the first element, 'ant', the condition evaluates to false and value isn't returned.

# When none of the conditions in an if statement evaluates as true, the if statement itself returns nil. That's why we see nil as the first element in the returned array.

# Practice Problem 10
# What is the return value of the following code? Why?

# [1, 2, 3].map do |num|
#   if num > 1
#     puts num
#   else
#     num
#   end
# end
# Hide Solution
# We can determine the block's return value by looking at the return value of the last statement evaluated within the block. In this case it's a bit tricky because of the if statement. For the first element, the if condition evaluates to false, which means num is the block's return value for that iteration. For the rest of the elements in the array, num > 1 evaluates to true, which means puts num is the last statement evaluated, which in turn, means that the block's return value is nil for those iterations.

# Therefore, the return value of map is:

# # => [1, nil, nil]
# Summary
# After completing these practice problems, you've hopefully been able to further solidify your knowledge and understanding of the concepts covered in the past three assignments. The key things to think about are:

# How does the method treat the block's return value?
# What is the return value of the method?
# How can you use the Ruby docs to learn more about a method?
# Is the method destructive?
# In the next lesson we'll focus on more complex concepts, so it's important to be comfortable with these fundamental concepts before moving forward.
