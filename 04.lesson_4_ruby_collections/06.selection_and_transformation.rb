# Selection and Transformation
# Now that we know how to loop through a collection, it's time to do something more interesting. Besides iteration, the two most common actions to perform on a collection are selection and transformation.

# Selection is picking certain elements out of the collection depending on some criterion. For example, pick out all the odd integers from an array. Transformation, on the other hand, refers to manipulating every element in the collection. For example, increment all elements of the array by 1. If there are n elements in a collection, selection results in n or less elements, while transformation always results in exactly n elements. Using these two actions, we can do nearly anything you can imagine to a collection. Therefore, it's critical to not only understand how to perform these actions, but to develop a high level of proficiency so you can quickly and fluently work with collections.

# Selection and transformation both utilize the basics of looping: a loop, a counter, a way to retrieve the current value, and a way to exit the loop. Keep those four things in mind. In addition, selection and transformation require some criteria; selection uses this criteria to determine which elements are selected, while transformation uses this criteria to determine how to perform the transformation.

# At this point, you've already seen some examples of selection and transformation in previous assignments, but here we'll analyze these two topics in more depth.

# Looping to Select and Transform
# Let's start by looking at an example of selection. There are an endless number of conditions that can be used to perform selection but a basic example involves the selection of a single character from a string.

# In the example below, we want to select all 'g' characters out of a string. You'll notice that this is just a basic loop with one main addition: the if statement.

# alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
# selected_chars = ''
# counter = 0

# loop do
#   current_char = alphabet[counter]

#   if current_char == 'g'
#     selected_chars << current_char    # appends current_char into the selected_chars string
#   end

#   counter += 1
#   break if counter == alphabet.size
# end

# selected_chars # => "g"
# The if condition is what determines which values are selected and which ones are ignored; this is the selection criteria. The rest of the code is just your basic loop iterating code.

# We can apply these same concepts to transformation. Let's again take a look at a simple array and loop through it, but with one addition: the modification of appending an 's' to each string in the array.

# fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear']
# transformed_elements = []
# counter = 0

# loop do
#   current_element = fruits[counter]

#   transformed_elements << current_element + 's'   # appends transformed string into array

#   counter += 1
#   break if counter == fruits.size
# end

# transformed_elements # => ["apples", "bananas", "pears"]
# Since we're applying the transformation to every element in the array, we don't need an if condition, but the entire line is the transformation criteria. Note that, in this example, we perform the transformation on a new array and leave the original array unchanged. When performing transformation, it's always important to pay attention to whether the original collection was mutated or if a new collection was returned.

# Extracting to Methods
# Most of the time, selecting or transforming a collection is a very specific action -- select all the odd numbers, turn all elements into strings, etc -- which naturally lends the specific action being extracted into convenience methods.

# Say for example we wanted to be able to select all of the vowels in a given string. We're going to use the helpful String#include? method here to assist us in determining whether a character is a vowel.

# if 'aeiouAEIOU'.include?(current_char)
#   selected_chars << current_char
# end
# Let's now put it all together into a select_vowels method so we can call this method on any string.

# def select_vowels(str)
#   selected_chars = ''
#   counter = 0

#   loop do
#     current_char = str[counter]

#     if 'aeiouAEIOU'.include?(current_char)
#       selected_chars << current_char
#     end

#     counter += 1
#     break if counter == str.size
#   end

#   selected_chars
# end
# An important thing to note here is that when our method is done iterating over the collection it returns a new collection containing the selected values. In this case, our select_vowels method returns a new string.

# select_vowels('the quick brown fox')      # => "euioo"

# sentence = 'I wandered lonely as a cloud'
# select_vowels(sentence)                   # => "Iaeeoeaaou"
# We can therefore call other methods on that return value.

# number_of_vowels = select_vowels('hello world').size
# number_of_vowels # => 3
# Let's now take a look at an example with hashes. In this example we want to select the key-value pairs where the value is 'Fruit'.

# produce = {
#   'apple' => 'Fruit',
#   'carrot' => 'Vegetable',
#   'pear' => 'Fruit',
#   'broccoli' => 'Vegetable'
# }

# select_fruit(produce) # => {"apple"=>"Fruit", "pear"=>"Fruit"}
# How would you implement a method like this?

# Hide Hint
# Remember that you have to loop through the keys in order to access the values
# Notice that the return value of the method is a hash
# Try coding a solution in a code file or irb and then check the answer:Hide Solution
# def select_fruit(produce_list)
#   produce_keys = produce_list.keys
#   counter = 0
#   selected_fruits = {}

#   loop do
#     # this has to be at the top in case produce_list is empty hash
#     break if counter == produce_keys.size

#     current_key = produce_keys[counter]
#     current_value = produce_list[current_key]

#     if current_value == 'Fruit'
#       selected_fruits[current_key] = current_value
#     end

#     counter += 1
#   end

#   selected_fruits
# end
# Notice that:

# the original argument, produce_list, is not mutated
# a new hash is returned by the method (as opposed to an array or string)
# We'll now move on to some transformation examples where the entire transformation code is within a method definition. The code below multiplies each element in the collection by 2.

# def double_numbers(numbers)
#   doubled_numbers = []
#   counter = 0

#   loop do
#     break if counter == numbers.size

#     current_number = numbers[counter]
#     doubled_numbers << current_number * 2

#     counter += 1
#   end

#   doubled_numbers
# end
# We can invoke the method like this.

# my_numbers = [1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6]
# double_numbers(my_numbers) # => [2, 8, 6, 14, 4, 12]
# Note that the double_numbers method returned a new array with every element doubled, and that the original array is not mutated. In other words, my_numbers is still [1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6]. This isn't a requirement, but just a consequence of how we implemented the method.

# If we wanted to, we could've easily decided that mutating the method argument is the right approach. Can you implement a double_numbers! method that mutates its argument?

# Try coding a solution in a code file or irb and then check the answer:Hide Solution
# def double_numbers!(numbers)
#   counter = 0

#   loop do
#     break if counter == numbers.size

#     current_number = numbers[counter]
#     numbers[counter] = current_number * 2

#     counter += 1
#   end

#   numbers
# end
# A couple items of note:

# rather than returning a new array, this method returns a reference to the (mutated) original array
# lines 7 and 8 can be shortened to 1 line: numbers[counter] = numbers[counter] * 2. This, in turn, can be further condensed to numbers[counter] *= 2.
# Now we can check our method like this.

# my_numbers = [1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6]
# double_numbers!(my_numbers)   # => [2, 8, 6, 14, 4, 12]

# my_numbers                    # => [2, 8, 6, 14, 4, 12]
# The argument, my_numbers, is permanently modified.

# We previously said that transformation is an operation that is performed on every element in the collection. In the next example, we'll study a method that only transforms a subset of the elements in the collection. Here, we only multiply by 2 if the value is odd. The if condition will only evaluate to true if current_number is odd (we check this using Integer#odd?).

# def double_odd_numbers(numbers)
#   doubled_numbers = []
#   counter = 0

#   loop do
#     break if counter == numbers.size

#     current_number = numbers[counter]
#     current_number *= 2 if current_number.odd?
#     doubled_numbers << current_number

#     counter += 1
#   end

#   doubled_numbers
# end
# Once again, note that we are working with a method that does not mutate its argument and instead returns a new array. We can call it like so:

# my_numbers = [1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6]
# double_odd_numbers(my_numbers)  # => [2, 4, 6, 14, 2, 6]

# # not mutated
# my_numbers                      # => [1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6]
# Exercise for the reader: What if we wanted to transform the numbers based on their position in the array rather than their value?

# Try coding a solution that doubles the numbers that have odd indices:Hide Solution
# We're going to write a rather contrived example where we want to double the elements where its index is an odd number.

# def double_odd_indices(numbers)
#   doubled_numbers = []
#   counter = 0

#   loop do
#     break if counter == numbers.size

#     current_number = numbers[counter]
#     current_number *= 2 if counter.odd?
#     doubled_numbers << current_number

#     counter += 1
#   end

#   doubled_numbers
# end

# my_numbers = [1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6]
# double_odd_indices(my_numbers) # => [1, 8, 3, 14, 2, 12]
# More Flexible Methods
# The examples we've looked at so far have taken one argument (the collection to be iterated over) and performed one operation to that collection. By defining our methods in such a way that we can pass in additional arguments to alter the logic of the iteration, we can create more flexible and generic methods.

# Recall earlier we wrote a select_fruit method that selected fruits out of the produce_list hash of fruits and vegetables. Suppose we wish to now write a more generic general_select method so that we can specify whether we're interested in selecting fruits or vegetables. Here's how we could build such a method:

# def general_select(produce_list, selection_criteria)
#   produce_keys = produce_list.keys
#   counter = 0
#   selected_fruits = {}

#   loop do
#     break if counter == produce_keys.size

#     current_key = produce_keys[counter]
#     current_value = produce_list[current_key]

#     # used to be current_value == 'Fruit'
#     if current_value == selection_criteria
#       selected_fruits[current_key] = current_value
#     end

#     counter += 1
#   end

#   selected_fruits
# end
# To use the above general_select method, we have to pass in a collection and some selection criteria. In this specific case, the criteria is hardcoded to match with a value: if there's a match between the criteria and value, then the current key-value pair is selected into the selected_fruits hash. Here's how we can use this method:

# produce = {
#   'apple' => 'Fruit',
#   'carrot' => 'Vegetable',
#   'pear' => 'Fruit',
#   'broccoli' => 'Vegetable'
# }

# general_select(produce, 'Fruit')     # => {"apple"=>"Fruit", "pear"=>"Fruit"}
# general_select(produce, 'Vegetable') # => {"carrot"=>"Vegetable", "broccoli"=>"Vegetable"}
# general_select(produce, 'Meat')      # => {}
# Note that we chose to not name the method select because of collision with Kernel#select, which does something completely different than what we're talking about here with collections.

# Continuing on with the idea of building generic methods, let's update our double_numbers method to not only be able to double the values in an array, but to multiply by any number. For example, let's create a method called multiply that can take an additional argument to determine the transformation criteria.

# my_numbers = [1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6]
# multiply(my_numbers, 3) # => [3, 12, 9, 21, 6, 18]
# Try coding a method that allows you to multiply every array item by a specified value:Hide Solution
# def multiply(numbers, multiplier)
#   multiplied_numbers = []
#   counter = 0

#   loop do
#     break if counter == numbers.size

#     multiplied_numbers << numbers[counter] * multiplier
#     counter += 1
#   end

#   multiplied_numbers
# end
# Note that the original argument is not mutated and that we're returning a new array here.

# We'll wrap up this assignment with one more example from earlier. Recall our initial selection example of selecting the letter 'g' out of the alphabet. Let's write a method called select_letter, that takes a string and returns a new string containing only the letter that we specified. We want it to behave like this:

# question = 'How many times does a particular character appear in this sentence?'
# select_letter(question, 'a') # => "aaaaaaaa"
# select_letter(question, 't') # => "ttttt"
# select_letter(question, 'z') # => ""
# def select_letter(sentence, character)
#   selected_chars = ''
#   counter = 0

#   loop do
#     break if counter == sentence.size
#     current_char = sentence[counter]

#     if current_char == character
#       selected_chars << current_char
#     end

#     counter += 1
#   end

#   selected_chars
# end
# And because select_letter returns a string, if we wanted to, we can continue to chain string methods on the return value. Suppose we wanted to find out how many times a letter occurs in a sentence, we could use our method above chained with String#size, like so:

# select_letter(question, 'a').size # => 8
# select_letter(question, 't').size # => 5
# select_letter(question, 'z').size # => 0
# Note that now the return value of the entire expression is an integer.

# The for loop

# So far, we've been using the Kernel#loop method in the examples to illustrate how to loop over a collection. But that's just one of many different ways to loop in Ruby. For example, the for loop produces the same result as loop:

# alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

# for char in alphabet.chars
#   puts char
# end
# To print each character, we just had to call the String#chars method on alphabet which splits each character into its own element in an array. In this example, char represents the value of the current element in the array.

# You can think of loop or for as interchangeable syntax, but we're going to use loop for consistency. You might see for being used elsewhere; don't worry about the syntax, the underlying concepts covered in this assignment still remain.

# Summary
# We often want to perform iteration, selection or transformation operations on a collection. Using these 3 actions, we can manipulate a collection nearly any way we need to.

# Typically, these are generic actions that we can move into a method, so that we can perform these generic operations repeatedly on different collections.

# Pay attention to when the original collection is mutated vs when the method returns a new collection. This might seem trivial right now, but it's a source of a lot of misunderstanding. Make certain to study this.

# Understand how these methods can be made more generic by allowing for additional parameters to specify some criteria for selection or transformation.

# Finally, it's common to chain actions on collections; but pay special mind to the return value, especially if the return value is an empty collection or nil. Trying to chain methods on empty collections or nil is dangerous and results in a lot of broken programs.
