Sorting
So far when exploring collections, we've looked at various different ways of working with them such as iterating through them, performing selection on the collection or performing transformation on the elements in the collection. We then studied various methods that can make those tasks easier.

Another common way of working with collections that we haven't yet talked about is to sort them into some kind of order. Sorting is mostly performed on arrays; since items in arrays are accessed via their index, the order in which those items appear is important.

Strings don't have access to any sorting methods (though, as we have seen previously, if you want to work with a string in the same way as an array it is easy to convert it into an array and then sort it).

Prior to Ruby 1.9, Hash objects did not maintain a set order so it was not possible to sort them. Since Ruby 1.9 it is possible to sort a hash, though because hash values are accessed via their keys there generally isn't a need to do this.

What is sorting?
Sorting is setting the order of the items in a collection according to a certain criterion. For example, if we look at these two arrays of integers:

[2, 5, 3, 4, 1]
[1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]
They both contain the exact same integers but in the second array the integers are ordered numerically.

Assuming that the first array in the above example is our starting point and we want to then get from that to the second array, how do we achieve this? We would need some kind of mechanism to use on the first array in order to put all the items of that array into a particular order.

With some of the other concepts we've looked at so far in this lesson - such as iteration, selection, and transformation - we've shown how those actions can be performed algorithmically, via the use of fairly simple looping mechanisms, before moving on to look at specific methods in Ruby that can do those things for us.

Although it is also possible to write looping code to perform sorting manually, this code would have to be fairly complex and is beyond the scope of what we're looking at in this lesson. Luckily for us Ruby provides a couple of methods that can do this complex work for us: sort and sort_by.

Going back to our previous example, we could call sort on the first array:

[2, 5, 3, 4, 1].sort # => [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]
The return value is a new array with the integers ordered sequentially according to their value.

Under the hood of the sort method is the complex algorithm we discussed earlier. We don't need to see this, or understand how the method is implemented, in order to use it. What we do need to understand though is the way in which sort applies criterion in order to return an ordered collection.

Comparison
Sorting is essentially carried out by comparing the items in a collection with each other, and ordering them based on the result of that comparison. Comparison is at the heart of how sorting works.

Sorting integers via comparison may seem obvious. For example we all know that 2 comes after 1 in numerical order, but how does Ruby know how to order items when it comes to sorting a collection?

Let's look at another example:

['c', 'a', 'e', 'b', 'd'].sort # => ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
Calling sort on the array of characters returns a new array of characters, ordered alphabetically. Again, this makes sense when viewed in isolation - after all, we know that 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c', etc.

When we call sort on an array though, it doesn't know whether that array contains integers, strings, or some other type of object; so how does it know how to order the elements in the array?

The answer is that it uses a method to determine this; the <=> method (sometimes referred to as the "spaceship" operator).

The <=> Method
Any object in a collection that we want to sort must implement a <=> method. This method performs comparison between two objects of the same type and returns a -1, 0, or 1, depending on whether the first object is less than, equal to, or greater than the second object; if the two objects cannot be compared then nil is returned.

2 <=> 1 # => 1
1 <=> 2 # => -1
2 <=> 2 # => 0
'b' <=> 'a' # => 1
'a' <=> 'b' # => -1
'b' <=> 'b' # => 0
1 <=> 'a' # => nil
The return value of the <=> method is used by sort to determine the order in which to place the items. If <=> returns nil to sort then it throws an argument error.

['a', 1].sort # => ArgumentError: comparison of String with 1 failed
The sort method doesn't actually care about how <=> compares items, all it is concerned about is the return value of the <=> method (that is, it's looking for -1, 0, 1 or nil). When using sort however, it is important to know how <=> performs comparison for the type of object that you want to sort; the place to check for that is in the documentation. If you want to sort a collection that contains particular types of objects (e.g. strings or integers) you need to know two things:

Does that object type implement a <=> comparison method?
If yes, what is the specific implementation of that method for that object type (e.g. String#<=> will be implemented differently to Integer#<=>).
If we look at the Ruby Documentation for String#<=> it simply tells us:

Comparisonâ€”Returns -1, 0, +1 or nil depending on whether string is less than, equal to, or greater than other_string.

The ASCII Table

Concepts like greater than, less than and equal to are fairly obvious when dealing with integers; but how does the String#<=> understand these concepts? The answer is that String order is determined by a character's position in the ASCII table.

It is this ASCII character order that determines the result if we compare one ASCII character with another using the String#<=> method.

For example comparing uppercase 'A' with lowercase 'a' returns -1 because 'A' precedes 'a' in ASCIIbetical order.

'A' <=> 'a' # => -1
Similarly '!' precedes 'A':

'!' <=> 'A' # => -1
You can determine a string's ASCII position by calling ord on the string.

'b'.ord # => 98
'}'.ord # => 125
Based on the above example we know that 'b' should come before '}'.

'b' <=> '}' # => -1
You don't need to memorize all the positions in the ASCII table, but when dealing with comparing or sorting strings it is important to know that they are ordered in a particular way and roughly what that order is. Some useful rules to remember are:

Uppercase letters come before lowercase letters
Digits and (most) punctuation come before letters
There is an extended ASCII table containing accented and other characters - this comes after the main ASCII table
The sort method
As we have already seen, we can simply call sort on an array, which returns a new array of ordered items; when we do this, comparisons are carried out using the <=> method on the items being sorted.

We can also call sort with a block; this gives us more control over how the items are sorted. The block needs two arguments passed to it (the two items to be compared) and the return value of the block has to be -1, 0, 1 or nil.

[2, 5, 3, 4, 1].sort do |a, b|
  a <=> b
end
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
In the above example, we're just using Integer#<=> in the block to perform the comparison, which is exactly what sort would have done by itself without the block of code. While this may not be the best example, it shows that the result is the same.

In the below example, by switching the order in which the items are compared the new array returned is in descending order.

[2, 5, 3, 4, 1].sort do |a, b|
  b <=> a
end
# => [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
You are allowed to write additional code in the block, as long as the block returns -1, 0, 1 or nil.

[2, 5, 3, 4, 1].sort do |a, b|
  puts "a is #{a} and b is #{b}"
  a <=> b
end
# a is 2 and b is 5
# a is 4 and b is 1
# a is 3 and b is 1
# a is 3 and b is 4
# a is 2 and b is 1
# a is 2 and b is 3
# a is 5 and b is 3
# a is 5 and b is 4
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Here we are outputting the value of the two items being compared each time sort calls the block. Although we can't see the algorithm underlying sort the number of comparisons and the order in which it performs them, should give you some idea as to its complexity.

As previously stated, when sorting a collection it is important to understand the <=> method of the items in the collection that you want to sort. Have a read through the Ruby Documentation for String#<=>. Without running the code, try to figure out what would be returned here:

['arc', 'bat', 'cape', 'ants', 'cap'].sort
Show Solution
There is also an Array#<=> method. Have a read of the Ruby Docs and see if you can work out what would be returned when sort is called on this array of arrays:

[['a', 'cat', 'b', 'c'], ['b', 2], ['a', 'car', 'd', 3], ['a', 'car', 'd']].sort
Show Solution
The sort_by method
sort_by is similar to sort but is usually called with a block. The code in the block determines how the items are compared.

['cot', 'bed', 'mat'].sort_by do |word|
  word[1]
end
# => ["mat", "bed", "cot"]
Here we are sorting using the character at index 1 of each string, so only the characters 'a', 'e' and 'o' are compared and the strings ordered according to the comparison of those characters. The other characters in the strings are ignored entirely.

We stated previously that there generally isn't a need to sort hashes, since hash values are accessed via their keys rather than position. If you did want to sort a hash however, calling sort_by on it would be a way to do so.

When calling sort_by on a hash, two arguments need to be passed to the block - the key and the value. In the people hash in the following example, the keys are each person's name and the values are their ages.

people = { Kate: 27, john: 25, Mike:  18 }
The last argument evaluated in the block should then be the thing by which we want to sort, so if we wanted the hash sorted by age we could do the following:

people.sort_by do |name, age|
  age
end
# => [[:Mike, 18], [:john, 25], [:Kate, 27]]
sort_by always returns an array, even when called on a hash, so the result here is a new array with the key-value pairs as objects in nested arrays. If we need to convert this back into a hash we can call Array#to_h on it.

What if we want to order the hash by name rather than age? The names in this example are symbols. As we discussed earlier, in order for sort to work, the objects that you want to compare must implement a <=> method. We therefore need to check the Ruby Documentation to see if there is a Symbol#<=> method and if so, how it carries out comparison.

If we read the description for Symbol#<=> it explains that the symbols are compared after to_s is called on them, and if we then read the documentation for Symbol#to_s we see that it "returns the name or string corresponding to" the symbol.

By using Symbol#<=> we are effectively comparing strings. We therefore know that we can sort our hash by name.

There's a problem though. You may have noticed that one of the names, :john, is not capitalized. Since strings are compared in 'ASCIIbetical' order, :john will come after :Kate and :Mike, which may not be what we want.

Luckily there is an easy way to deal with this problem. We can use the Symbol#capitalize method on each name within the block so that when the keys are compared they are all capitalized.

people.sort_by do |name, age|
  name.capitalize
end
# => [[:john, 25], [:Kate, 27], [:Mike, 18]]
Note: Array#sort and Array#sort_by have a equivalent destructive methods Array#sort! and Array#sort_by!. With these methods, rather then returning a new collection, the same collection is returned but sorted. These methods are specific to arrays and are not available to hashes. As a general practice, always pay attention to whether the method you're invoking is destructive or returns a new collection (or both). The ! in the method name is only a guide, and many destructive methods do not contain !; you have to read the documentation carefully.

Other methods which use comparison
As we have seen, comparison is at the heart of how sort and sort_by work. Ruby has some other methods which use comparison in order to work with collections. Again, the objects being compared need to implement a <=> method in order for these methods to be used.

min
max
minmax
min_by
max_by
minmax_by
Descriptions and examples of these methods can be found in the Ruby Documentation for the Enumerable module. As explained in a previous assignment, these Enumerable methods are available to Array and Hash because they include this module. Don't worry too much about what this means for now, just understand that you can call these methods on arrays and hashes.

Summary
In this assignment we've looked at sorting as another way we can work with collections. A few important points to remember:

Sorting is complex to carry out algorithmically on your own, but we can use the built-in sort and sort_by methods to do the complex work for us.
Comparison is at the heart of sorting. When sorting collections, you need to know if the objects you want to sort on implement a <=> method and how that method is defined.
Methods other than sort and sort_by also use comparison as the basis for how they work.
At this point you should understand the concept of sorting and be comfortable using the sort and sort_by methods.
