# Introduction
# At this point, you should have basic familiarity with Ruby syntax and foundational programming constructs. But that knowledge immediately starts to fade from memory the minute you step away from programming. Just like mastering any skill, it takes hundreds of hours of practice to build muscle memory in your fingers, and let that knowledge move to long term memory in your brain.

# One challenge for beginning programmers is trying to find the right types of practice problems. Again, just like acquiring any skill, it's important to practice basics in isolation first, without being confused by more advanced topics. You need to learn new topics, then practice them in isolation, then learn new topics, and repeat. After a certain amount of practice, you will then be ready to learn in context with a project.

# The purpose of this lesson is to help you practice topics in isolation without introducing you to advanced topics, or challenging you to think about the context within a larger project. Think of it as jump-roping, or doing push-ups for your programming mind. You may not understand the impact of each practice problem, but over time, you'll see results and you'll be able to perform better when you work on more complicated programs.

# Before you start, make sure to create a peer directory to your lesson 2 code. Call it perhaps lesson_3, and do all your work in this lesson in that directory.

# Your working directory should now look something like this:

# work            <-- this is your course 1 git repo
# |
# +--lesson_2     <-- all lesson 2 code goes here
# |
# +--lesson_3     <-- all lesson 3 code goes here
# We won't be running Rubocop on code in this lesson, because they're pretty small and contained. We want to focus on learning to problem solve and debugging.
