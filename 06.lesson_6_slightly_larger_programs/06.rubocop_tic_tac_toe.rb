Rubocop Tic Tac Toe
Now that we have a functional program, we are now ready to tidy up our code. Watch the video below on how to use Rubocop to refactor and improve the Tic Tac Toe code. Remember to use the updated .rubocop.yml file from this lesson. Remember, we're not looking to change the functionality of the program here, and we have to use our own judgement on whether Rubocop is giving us good advice. In general, it probably is, but you do not have to fix every offense if you have a good reason.

Note: this video shows a Rubocop complaint for Metrics/MethodLength. Using the current version of the .rubocop.yml file, you won't see this complaint.
